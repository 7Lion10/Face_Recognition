# 👤 Face Recognition Web Application

## 📌 Overview
The **Face Recognition Web App** is a Python-based application built with **Flask** and **OpenCV** that identifies and recognizes human faces from uploaded images.  
It leverages **deep learning-based facial recognition algorithms** to achieve over **95% accuracy** in matching and identifying faces.  
The project features a responsive and user-friendly web interface and can even run seamlessly on **mobile browsers** for cross-platform accessibility.

## 🧠 Features
- 🧍 Detect and recognize faces from uploaded images  
- ⚡ High accuracy using deep learning-based facial feature extraction  
- 🌐 Built with Flask for lightweight web deployment  
- 🖼️ Interactive and responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- 📱 Compatible with both desktop and mobile browsers  
- 🗂️ Organized file handling and image preprocessing pipeline  
- 🔁 Version control and collaboration managed via GitHub
